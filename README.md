- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike
- 👀 I’m an engineer, private practice, wishing to make work a little easier through programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to make use of all the stuff that is being developed.
- 💞️ Pretty much experienced with VB, and C for applications. Maybe C++ in future.
- 📫 Sorry no social media for me, little value, too censored, and political.
