- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike
- 👀 I’m an engineer, private practice, wishing to make work a little easier through programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to make use of all the increditable stuff being developed.
- 💞️ Pretty much experienced with VB and C for desktop applications and embedded systems. Maybe C++ in future.
- 📫 Sorry, no social media for me anymore: too many advertisements, too censored now, and way too political.
